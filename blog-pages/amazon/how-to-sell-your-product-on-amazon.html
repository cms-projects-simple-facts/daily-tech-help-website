    <li>Partnership / LLP</li>
    <li>Trust or Society</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Essential Documents</h3>
  <p>The following documents are necessary to complete your seller registration:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Document</th>
      <th>Required For</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PAN Card</td>
      <td>Mandatory for tax purposes</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Required for most products; some exemptions exist</td>

    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>2. Legalities You Should Be Aware Of</h2>
  <p>Selling online involves tax registration, brand protection, and compliance with product regulations. Make sure your business is legally compliant to avoid disruptions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GST Registration:</strong> Required for most goods unless they fall under exempt categories. Apply via <a href="https://www.gst.gov.in">gst.gov.in</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Trademark:</strong> Not mandatory, but highly recommended for brand protection and joining Amazon Brand Registry.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Compliance:</strong> Amazon deducts TDS/TCS and provides reports for filing income and GST returns.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Compliance:</strong> Follow packaging regulations like Legal Metrology, BIS certification if applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Registration Process</h2>
  <p>To become an Amazon seller, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://services.amazon.in">services.amazon.in</a> and click on "Start Selling".</li>
    <li>Sign in with your existing Amazon account or create a new seller account.</li>
    <li>Provide all the required business and tax-related details.</li>
    <li>Choose the categories of products you wish to sell and complete your registration.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Preparing Product Listings</h2>
  <p>Listings are how customers see your products. Make them accurate, informative, and attractive to increase sales.</p>
  <h3>Key Components</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product Title:</strong> Include key features like gender, material, and color.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Quality Images:</strong> Minimum 1000x1000 px, white background, multiple views.</li>
    <li><strong>Description and Bullet Points:</strong> Use detailed text and short highlights to explain product features.</li>
    <li><strong>Category and SKU:</strong> Correct categorization helps with discoverability. SKU is your internal code.</li>
    <li><strong>Price and Quantity:</strong> Show MRP and your actual selling price. Keep your inventory updated.</li>
    <li><strong>Variants:</strong> Combine color and size under one product using parent-child relationships.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Listing Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manual:</strong> Best for a small number of products. Add products one by one using Seller Central.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk Upload:</strong> Use Amazonâ€™s Excel templates to list many products at once. Suitable for large inventories.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Shipping Options</h2>
  <p>Amazon offers multiple shipping models depending on how involved you want to be in the logistics process.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Easy Ship</h3>

    <li>You only need to handle packing and scheduling pickup.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Self-Ship</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You are fully responsible for packing, shipping, and customer service.</li>
    <li>Best suited for niche products or remote delivery areas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Packaging Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Good packaging ensures your product reaches the customer safely and looks professional.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use tamper-proof, sturdy packaging material.</li>
    <li>Include an invoice and Amazon shipping label with every order.</li>
    <li>For apparel, fold neatly and pack in polybags or clothing boxes.</li>
    <li>Label sizes clearly and add barcodes if required.</li>
  </ul>
